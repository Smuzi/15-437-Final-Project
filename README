mc2xml:
We use someone elses code for web-crawling channel listings. It's called mc2xml
and is located at: http://mc2xml.hosterbox.net/
Note that because this code is closed source we needed to do some hackish things
(but no more hackish than parsing websites as we originally intended to do).
Details are located in our xmltv parse script
